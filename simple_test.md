# Simple Test Project: Hello World API

Create a minimal FastAPI application to test the platform end-to-end.

## Requirements

### Backend
- Single Python file with FastAPI
- Two endpoints:
  - GET / - Returns {"message": "Hello World"}
  - GET /health - Returns {"status": "healthy"}

### Deliverables
- main.py with the API code
- requirements.txt with just FastAPI and uvicorn
- Simple README with one-line setup instruction

That's it! Keep it as simple as possible - this is just to test the platform.
